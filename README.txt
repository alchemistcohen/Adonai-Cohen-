# Adonai Cohen - Personal Website

Welcome to the official repository of **Adonai Cohen’s personal website**.  
This site serves as a digital space to present my work, thoughts, and projects.

## About the Author

I am **Adonai Cohen**, a Chemical Engineer, Data Scientist, and AI enthusiast with a strong interest in philosophy, psychoanalysis, and cultural analysis.  
Beyond the technical field, I dedicate part of my work to writing books and reflections on human behavior, society, and the role of technology in our lives.

### Publications
- **Hero or NPC** – A philosophical exploration of modern society, where I compare most people’s lives to non-playable characters (NPCs) in video games, guided by impulses, trends, and external influences rather than conscious purpose.
